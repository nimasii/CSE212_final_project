# CSE 212 Final Project

## Welcome

This semester I learned about many different types of data structers and their uses in programming in python.
This project will overview and provide a tutorial for three of those data structures.
- Stacks
- Linked Lists
- Trees

Each tutorial will introduce the basic concepts of the data structure including what makes it unique.
Each tutorial will also include a worked example of an application of the data structure and problem to solve using the data structure.
